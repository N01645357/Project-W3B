                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.</p>
                <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.</p>

                <h2>Notable Features</h2>
                <p>Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are much larger – but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000 Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun's volume.</p>
                <p>The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system: red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B – two sunlike stars orbiting each other – are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers).</p>

                <h2>Exploration</h2>
                <p>Humanity's exploration of Saturn began with telescopic observations, and later space missions provided close-up studies. Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to fly by Saturn in 1979. Voyager 1 and 2 provided more detailed images and data in 1980 and 1981, respectively.</p>
                <p>The Cassini-Huygens mission, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and ASI, was the most extensive exploration of Saturn. Launched in 1997, Cassini orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, studying the planet, its rings, and its moons. The Huygens probe landed on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, in 2005, providing unprecedented data about its surface and atmosphere.</p>

                <h2>Moons</h2>
                <p>Saturn has a stunning array of 82 known moons. Titan, the largest, is larger than Mercury and has a dense atmosphere. It's the only moon in the Solar System with substantial liquid bodies on its surface, primarily methane and ethane lakes and seas.</p>
                <p>Another notable moon is Enceladus, which has become a prime candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean. Plumes of water vapor erupting from Enceladus' south pole, discovered by the Cassini spacecraft, suggest the potential for hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor.</p>
