            <h1>The Moon</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the Solar System. It is about a quarter the size of Earth, making it relatively large compared to its parent planet. The Moon is about 384,400 km away from Earth and plays a significant role in influencing the Earth's tides.</p>
                <p>The surface of the Moon is marked by craters, mountains, and flat planes called 'maria,' which are large, dark, basaltic plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. The Moon has a very thin and weak atmosphere, called an exosphere, which does not provide protection from the sun's rays or cosmic radiation.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Phases and Eclipses</h2>
                <p>The Moon is well-known for its phases, changing its appearance as it orbits Earth. These phases range from new moon, first quarter, full moon, to last quarter, repeating every 29.5 days. The Moon's phases are the result of its position relative to the Earth and the Sun.</p>
                <p>Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. Solar eclipses happen when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth. These events have fascinated humans for millennia and are important in many cultural and scientific contexts.</p>

                <h2>Exploration</h2>
                <p>The Moon has been a focal point for space exploration. The Soviet Union's Luna program in the 1950s and 1960s was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft. The United States' Apollo program achieved the first manned moon landing in 1969 with Apollo 11, and five more manned landings followed until 1972.</p>
                <p>Recent missions have included orbiters, landers, and rovers from various space agencies, aiming to study the Moon's composition, history, and potential resources. The Moon is also a significant target for future human space exploration and a potential stepping stone for missions to Mars and beyond.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
                <p>Scientifically, the Moon provides insights into the early history of the Solar System. Its relatively unchanged surface records over 4.5 billion years of planetary evolution. Studies of lunar rocks have helped scientists understand the age and composition of the Solar System, as well as Earth's own history.</p>
                <p>The Moon's potential for scientific research extends to astronomy and physics. Its far side, shielded from Earth's electromagnetic interference, is considered an ideal location for deep space telescopes and observatories, potentially allowing for unprecedented observations of the universe.</p>
